# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where both the input and the correct output are provided. The goal is to learn a mapping function from input to output that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Common supervised learning algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, where only inputs are provided without corresponding correct outputs. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data.

Types of unsupervised learning:
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together
- **Association Rules**: Finding relationships between different variables
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving important information

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time.

Key components:
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world the agent interacts with
- Actions: What the agent can do
- Rewards: Feedback from the environment

## Mathematical Foundations

### Linear Regression
The basic linear regression model can be expressed as:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon$$

Where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable
- $x_i$ are the independent variables
- $\beta_i$ are the coefficients
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

### Cost Function
For linear regression, the cost function (Mean Squared Error) is:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$

## Model Evaluation

### Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent dataset. The most common method is k-fold cross-validation.

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Overfitting and Underfitting

**Overfitting** occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new data.

**Underfitting** happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.

Solutions:
- Regularization (L1, L2)
- Feature selection
- Cross-validation
- Early stopping
- More/better training data
