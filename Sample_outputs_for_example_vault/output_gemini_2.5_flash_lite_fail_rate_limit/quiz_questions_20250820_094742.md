### Question 8

**Type:** Short Answer
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** In the context of linear regression, what does the term $\epsilon$ represent in the equation $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon$?

**Question:** What is the mathematical formula for the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function used in linear regression, where $m$ is the number of training examples, $h_	heta(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted value for the $i$-th example, and $y^{(i)}$ is the actual value?

**Answer:** $$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$

**Explanation:** This is the standard formula for Mean Squared Error, often used as the cost function in linear regression to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.
