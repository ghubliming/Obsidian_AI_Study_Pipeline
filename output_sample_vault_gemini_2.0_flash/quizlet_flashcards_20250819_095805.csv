Term,Definition
"According to the provided text, what is the core principle of supervised learning in machine learning?",Training a model on labeled data with both input and correct output.
What is supervised learning in the context of Machine Learning?,Training a model on labeled data where both the input and desired output are provided.
What is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data (inputs with correct outputs), while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data (inputs only)."
"What is the primary difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and what characteristic of the dataset determines which type of learning is applicable?","Supervised learning uses labeled data (input and correct output), while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data (only input). The presence or absence of labels determines which type is applicable."
"In the context of an agent interacting with an environment to learn decision-making, what are the four key components?","Agent, Environment, Actions, and Rewards."
"In a Reinforcement Learning setting, what are the four key components that define the system?","Agent, Environment, Actions, and Rewards."
"Explain the purpose of the cost function J(θ) in the context of linear regression, and what each component of the formula represents.  Specifically, what is $h_	heta(x^{(i)})$ and $y^{(i)}$?","The cost function J(θ) measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in linear regression. It quantifies how well the model fits the data.  $h_	heta(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted value for the i-th data point, based on the linear model parameters θ and input features x. $y^{(i)}$ is the actual observed value for the i-th data point."
"What is the cost function (Mean Squared Error) used in linear regression, and what do its components represent?","J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σ(i=1 to m) [h_θ(x^(i)) - y^(i)]^2, where:

*   `J(θ)` is the cost function.
*   `m` is the number of training examples.
*   `h_θ(x^(i))` is the predicted value for the i-th example.
*   `y^(i)` is the actual value for the i-th example."
"Explain the difference between overfitting and underfitting in the context of machine learning models, and relate it to how well the model generalizes to new data.","Overfitting means a model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor generalization. Underfitting means a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, also resulting in poor generalization."
"Explain the difference between precision and recall, and why is the F1-score a useful metric for evaluating a model's performance?","Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (true positives out of all predicted positives), while recall measures the model's ability to find all actual positives (true positives out of all actual positives). The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure when there's an uneven class distribution or when both minimizing false positives and false negatives are important."
What are the solutions to overfitting in machine learning models?,"Regularization (L1, L2), Feature selection, Cross-validation, Early stopping, More/better training data."
"What is the fundamental building block of a neural network, and what are its primary functions?","The fundamental building block is a neuron (or node). Its primary functions are to receive inputs, apply a transformation, and produce an output."
