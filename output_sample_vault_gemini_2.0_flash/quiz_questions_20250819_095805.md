**Number of Questions:** 11

### Question 1

**Type:** Short Answer
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** According to the provided text, what is the core principle of supervised learning in machine learning?

**Answer:** Training a model on labeled data with both input and correct output.

**Explanation:** The definition of supervised learning explicitly states that it utilizes labeled data where the input and corresponding output are provided to the model during training. This allows the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.

**Question:** What is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?

**Answer:** Supervised learning uses labeled data (inputs with correct outputs), while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data (inputs only).

### Question 4

**Type:** Short Answer
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** What is the primary difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and what characteristic of the dataset determines which type of learning is applicable?

**Answer:** Supervised learning uses labeled data (input and correct output), while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data (only input). The presence or absence of labels determines which type is applicable.

**Explanation:** The key distinction lies in whether the data has corresponding 'correct' outputs. Supervised learning 'learns' the relationship between inputs and outputs, whereas unsupervised learning tries to find patterns within the input data itself.

### Question 7

**Type:** Short Answer
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** Explain the purpose of the cost function J(θ) in the context of linear regression, and what each component of the formula represents.  Specifically, what is $h_	heta(x^{(i)})$ and $y^{(i)}$?

**Answer:** The cost function J(θ) measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in linear regression. It quantifies how well the model fits the data.  $h_	heta(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted value for the i-th data point, based on the linear model parameters θ and input features x. $y^{(i)}$ is the actual observed value for the i-th data point.

**Explanation:** The question tests understanding of the cost function for linear regression, specifically the Mean Squared Error (MSE). The answer should demonstrate the ability to identify the predicted value and actual value and how they relate to the evaluation of the model's performance.

### Question 8

**Type:** Flashcard
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** What is the cost function (Mean Squared Error) used in linear regression, and what do its components represent?

**Answer:** J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σ(i=1 to m) [h_θ(x^(i)) - y^(i)]^2, where:

*   `J(θ)` is the cost function.
*   `m` is the number of training examples.
*   `h_θ(x^(i))` is the predicted value for the i-th example.
*   `y^(i)` is the actual value for the i-th example.

**Explanation:** The cost function measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The goal of linear regression is to minimize this cost function by adjusting the parameters (coefficients) θ.

### Question 9

**Type:** Short Answer
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** Explain the difference between overfitting and underfitting in the context of machine learning models, and relate it to how well the model generalizes to new data.

**Answer:** Overfitting means a model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor generalization. Underfitting means a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, also resulting in poor generalization.

**Explanation:** The content explicitly defines overfitting as learning noise, and implicitly defines underfitting as a failure to learn the training data well. Both lead to poor performance on independent datasets, which is the essence of failing to generalize.

### Question 10

**Type:** Short Answer
**Source:** Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Question:** Explain the difference between precision and recall, and why is the F1-score a useful metric for evaluating a model's performance?

**Answer:** Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (true positives out of all predicted positives), while recall measures the model's ability to find all actual positives (true positives out of all actual positives). The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure when there's an uneven class distribution or when both minimizing false positives and false negatives are important.

**Explanation:** The question tests understanding of the definitions of precision and recall, and why the F1-score is used as a combined metric. A good answer will describe the key differences between the two metrics and why using only one can be misleading depending on the situation.
